#LLM

A Large Language Model (LLM) is an advanced AI system trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and process human language. These models use deep learning techniques, particularly transformers (like GPT, BERT, or LLaMA), to recognize patterns, predict words, and generate human-like responses.

#Traditional AI in DevOps

Traditional AI relies on **structured data, pre-defined rules, and predictive models** trained on historical data. It excels at classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection.


## Key Differences Summary

| Feature            | Traditional AI                     | Generative AI                     |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Data Type**      | Structured (logs, metrics)    | Structured + Unstructured (logs, docs, chat)  |
| **Approach**       | Predictive, classification-based | Generative, contextual understanding |
| **Use Case**       | Detect anomalies, forecast failures | Explain failures, automate remediation |
| **Example**        | Alerts on high CPU usage       | Summarizes logs & suggests fixes |
| **Limitation**     | Requires labeled datasets     | May generate incorrect suggestions (hallucinations) |
